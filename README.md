# Fourth-Assignment

This homework is in two parts!

# Part One - HTML/CSS

- finish (or fix) Assignment Two if you haven't already!
- finish (or fix) your portfolio site if you haven't already!
- e-mail me the link

# Part Two - Processing

- I have discoverd an ancient drawing and want to reproduce it, but unfortuantely I am alergic to ink and can not redraw it. I've also lost the use of my hands. So, my only recourse is to have someone else program it for me. Also, lucky for you, I've found someone to start the assignemnt so you're not starting entirely from scratch. They've also annotated the drawing with RED!
- Your job is to look at the picture below and use the Processing knowledge we covered in class (also i have the code online for you) and reproduce the drawing.
- Things to consider:
  - RED MEANS NOTES (JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION DO NOT REPRODUCE)
  - there are a couple shapes we didn't cover (don't panic!) use this URL https://processing.org/reference/ and try and figure it out. It's ok if you don't. circles are called "ellipse" and triangles are called "traingle" :)
  - the drawing doesn't have exact x, y coordinates for each of the shapes. So you'll have to guess or use trial and error to figure them out.
  - your code will not reproduce it EXACTLY. THAT'S OK.
  - all the code required is in the example. just copy, paste, and change values
    - x, y, width, height, stroke, fill, type of shape are the things you'll change. 
- take a screenshot (cmd+shift+4) of your reproduction
- add the screenshot to your porfolio with short description. you can either copy all your files over to "assignment_004" or just update your site in the "assignment_003" folder.
- e-mail me the link by Thursday @ Midnight along with 2 questions about HTML/CSS or Processing

Thanks!
